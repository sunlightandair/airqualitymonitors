# airqualitymonitors
The Clean Air Council is in the process of developing a low-cost personal air quality monitor for use in the Marcellus Shale region. The monitor measures various pollutants in real time and displays readings through bluetooth using an Android app called Aircasting.Â The current prototype will attempt to measure PM, methane, noise pollution (dB), and tVOCs. It's our hope that these readings will give local residents peace of mind, while collecting important data on air quality around fracking sites and  pipelines, and around Philadelphia. This project is a proof of concept for citizen air quality monitoring, and creating a local air quality monitoring network.

To get started download the [AirCasting app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.llp.aircasting&hl=eng). 

Debugging and output from usb to a text file is handled with [gobetwino](http://mikmo.dk/gobetwino.html), this will give more detailed outputs in a more easily accesible format that can be copied directly to excel. 

More info on design and construction of hardware (as well as a bill of materials) incoming as well as 3d printing files for recreating the current "skeleton".
