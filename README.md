# airqualitymonitors
The Clean Air Council is in the process of developing a low-cost personal air quality monitor for use in the Marcellus Shale region. The monitor measures various pollutants in real time and displays readings through bluetooth using an Android app called Aircasting.Â The current prototype will attempt to measure PM, methane, noise pollution (dB), and tVOCs. It's our hope that these readings will give local residents peace of mind, while collecting important data on air quality around fracking sites and  pipelines, and around Philadelphia. This project is a proof of concept for citizen air quality monitoring, and creating a local air quality monitoring network.
